'DumpMyRideUI' v0.1 alpha
(c) 2017 SillyBits


'DumpMyRideUI' allows for browsing and dumping contents of SyncMyRide update packages for Ford's SyncII
(a.k.a. MyFord Touch, or short MFT).


'DumpMyRideUI' is solely written in Python (v3.5 as of now) and uses TkInter for it's UI, so it should 
run on a fairly wide range of operating systems (https://www.python.org).
'DumpMyRideUI' is open source and is available for free (https://github.com/SillyBits/DumpMyRideUI).
